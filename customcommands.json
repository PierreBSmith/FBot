She was going to get rid of it but I wanted to keep it. She started reading through it to me to tease me. When she got to the section about Ernie taking a bubble bath with his rubber ducky in her teasing voice it awoke something in me I didnâ€™t know about myself before. We kept that book and now she reads it to me on my birthdays before we have bubble bath sex."
